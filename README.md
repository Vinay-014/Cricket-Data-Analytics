# Cricket Data Analytics

Welcome to **Cricket Data Analytics**, a project focused on analyzing cricket match data to uncover insights about player performance, team strategies, and match outcomes. This repository leverages Python and data science tools to process, analyze, and visualize cricket datasets, providing actionable insights for enthusiasts, analysts, and teams.

## Project Overview
This project explores cricket data (e.g., IPL or T20 World Cup stats) to answer questions like:
- Which players consistently perform under pressure?
- What factors contribute to a teamâ€™s victory?
- How do batting/bowling stats vary across conditions?

The analysis is powered by Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, with datasets sourced from public platforms like Kaggle or web scraping.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocesses raw cricket data for consistency and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends like runs scored, wickets taken, and win/loss ratios.
- **Player Performance Metrics**: Evaluates individual stats (e.g., batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy).

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and documentation.
